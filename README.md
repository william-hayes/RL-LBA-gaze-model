# A Reinforcement and Sequential Sampling Model Constrained by Gaze Data

* model_functions.R contains functions for simulating and fitting models 1-7 in the main text.
* model_functions_v2.R contains functions for simulating and fitting the trial-dependent decision threshold models.
* ExpDesignFigure.R generates the reward distributions in Figure 1A.
* Fig1_Qvalues.R generates the Q-value plot in Figure 1B.
* drift_heatmap.R generates Figures S1 and S2 (plus an additional figure for RT effects).
